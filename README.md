# Programming and Scripting Project 2019 - Fisherâ€™s Iris data set

This repository contains the project about Fisher's Iris data set. It includes documentation and code in Python based on researches. 

[See here for the instructions](https://github.com/ianmcloughlin/project-pands/raw/master/project.pdf)

## The main goal and the key points

* Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
* Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
* Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
* Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
* Write a summary of your investigations.
* Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.
